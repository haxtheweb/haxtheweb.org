<p>The HAX UI can be broken down into three major production concepts. Content authors are either:</p>
<ol><li>Adding something they already have<br/></li>
<li>Editing the Settings of the activated element on the page</li>
<li>Search for media from remote sources<br/></li>
<li>Add in a Template or predefined layout into the page</li>
</ol>
