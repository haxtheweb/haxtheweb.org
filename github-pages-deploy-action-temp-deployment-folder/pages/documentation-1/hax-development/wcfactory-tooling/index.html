<p>We made tooling to publish web components with ease and in any library. It's called WCFactory and while not required, it's the tooling we use for managing HAX and the many related elements in our library.</p>
<h4>Convenience Installation Script</h4>

<p>A factory that churns out web components, library agnostic with a unified development, testing, and build to production pipeline. We want to eliminate the barriers to web component adoption because as of Oct 23rd, 89.18% of all traffic can handle web components with no polyfills. Get it on <b>npm</b>
 or <b>yarn</b>
 and get publishing!</p>
