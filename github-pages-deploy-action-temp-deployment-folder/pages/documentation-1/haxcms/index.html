<p>HAXcms, that which powers the site you are currently reading is a powerful "static site generator" paradigm. It leverages server technology in order to orchestrate a static site. That way the "server" is only used when needed for a user to securely develop their content.</p>
<h2>Difference from past static generators</h2>
<p>Unlike solutions like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>

, HAXcms is for anyone to publish a website, not just those that understand command line. HAXcms is intended to be installed and then allow users to entirely use a UI to create, publish and manage micro-sites.</p>
<h2>Visualization</h2>

Static sites are published from the files you work with yet whatever you edit via the UI is always saved into a static format that works anywhere." style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"/>
