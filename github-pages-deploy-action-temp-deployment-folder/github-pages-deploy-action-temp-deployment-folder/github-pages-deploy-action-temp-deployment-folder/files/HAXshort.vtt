00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.770
If I want to upload
a file to Box,

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.540
why do I need to go to Box?

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.459
Why do I need you to know
Box exists if I'm a user?

4
00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.000
Why do I need to have training
in all these different systems

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.380
and where to go and URLs?

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.926
Why can't I just
go to the place I

7
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:13.800
know students are going
to be, whether that's

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.900
a content management
system, learning management

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.290
system, what have you, and
drag and drop my file and get

10
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.130
asked, would you like this
to be saved somewhere?

11
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.080
With [INAUDIBLE]
centers in one page,

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.140
you can identify the things
that you want to use.

13
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.080
So if you want to use images or
if you want to upload a video,

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.150
do you want to have the text or
the transcriptions on the page?

15
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.182
You can upload all
those pieces easily.

16
00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:39.640
Would you like this
to be presented

17
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.900
as a link or an inline
PDF or whatever,

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.940
instead of right
now where you have,

19
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.640
I got to go figure out
where to place this file.

20
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.290
I got to set
permissions correctly.

21
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.912
I need you to know enough HTML
in order to make it show up,

22
00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:56.620
all of things that
I'm going to be judged

23
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.810
on if I'm a faculty
member that I really

24
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.502
shouldn't need to know.

25
00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:01.960
They like it more
just because they

26
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.450
can be part of that process,
whereas before some things

27
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.830
were a little bit
harder for them

28
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.538
to use because they're
not as comfortable

29
00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:09.040
with the technology.

30
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.200
A lot of times once they
are done writing content,

31
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.430
I kind of moved on my own.

32
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.800
We can kind of do
this collaboratively,

33
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.110
just because the technology
is a lot easier to use.

34
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.030
What use to take say
three or four steps,

35
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.930
now it take one because it is
on that one kind of page format,

36
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.560
where you can select which
pieces you want to use.

37
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.860
So we really ultimately don't
want people going anywhere

38
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.570
to accomplish the
thing they want.

39
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.270
The future of our
authoring experience

40
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.710
will basically be people click
once and do the thing they want

41
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.070
and then forget about it.
