<p>The app store specification is what provides HAX with it's raw data integration capabilities. It's a block of JSON that tells HAXeditor the rules by which it is to play by. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/h-a-x/demo/appstore.json">A complete example is available in the h-a-x tag's demo</a>




 but we'll outline what the different parts of this JSON supports as well as one app in detail.</p>
<h2>Keys and what they mean</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Apps</b>



 - A source of data either to upload or search. Apps supply the definition of how to connect to the remote data, search it, upload things to it.</li>


<li><b>Blox</b>



 - A block of elements. Blox are a series of elements wrapped inside of a plate element. Blox can be modified in pieces but fundamentally the entire thing is one piece. A block can be moved up and down as an entire group.</li>


<li><b>Stax</b>



 - A stack of elements is a series of HTML elements that are added into the DOM all at once. Think of these like aÂ <br/></li>


<li><b>Autoloader</b>



 - A series of elements that are automatically to be loaded when HAX is setup.</li>


</ul>
