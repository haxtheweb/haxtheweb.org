<p>By design we've got a very simple structure. The goal of HAXcms isn't to lock you into anything and so we've simplified our file structure over other solutions.</p>
<p>The key directories / files include:</p>
<ul><li>files - any files you've uploaded through the HAX interface</li>

<li>pages - folders named by their content uri that have index.html in it, no structure other then what you created when hitting save</li>
<li>site.json - JSON Outline Schema object that defines the pages in your site and their relationship to each other<br/></li>
<li>index.html - front page of the PWA that stitch it all together</li>
<li>service-worker.js - makes it a PWA, no need to edi this</li>
</ul>
