<p>Theme skinning is the easiest way to build a decent looking theme in HAXcms. This method is geared toward people that know CSS and HTML but can't get into the weeds of web components or javascript.</p>
<p>Workflow</p>
<ol><li>Make a new site in the HAXcms UI</li>

<li>Select "Custom theme" as your theme</li>
<li>In the file system go to _sites/<i style="">mynewsite</i>
/theme</li>
<li>Edit theme.html to modify the structure</li>
<li>Edit theme.css to modify the design</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is the easiest way to skin HAXcms to your liking. It's able to ship and work in CDNs and is the minimal barrier to entry for those used to seeing HTML and CSS files that they can touch and see the change. It requires no tooling to utilize either!</span></p>
