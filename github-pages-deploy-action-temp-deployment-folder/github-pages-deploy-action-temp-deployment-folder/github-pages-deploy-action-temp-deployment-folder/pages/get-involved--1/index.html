<p>HAX makes up multiple projects across hundreds of web components and various other repos. It can be a bit overwhelming but we want you to imagine something... Imagine being a developer on HAX.</p>

<p>Because all it takes to get involved in HAX is, that's right, showing up in our repos and getting involved! Yes you too can be just as special and meme-able as we are!</p>
<p>All things HAX are powered by people just like you, wanting to make the web a better, more accessible, easier to use, less painful to develop for... place.<span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Help us make that a reality and you too could have Snoop Dawg escorting you over to a brand new car*</span></p>
