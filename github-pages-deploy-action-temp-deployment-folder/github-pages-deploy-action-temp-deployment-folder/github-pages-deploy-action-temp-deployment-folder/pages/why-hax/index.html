<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ul><li>Support all platforms and devices (CMS, App, etc)</li>

<li>Empower authors to write code without ever looking at code</li>

<li>All content produced must work with or without HAXeditor available</li>

<li>Support older markup, regardless of structure, as best we can</li>

<li>HAX will learn the rules of producing elements, it won't dictate them</li>


<li>Decentralize all the things, empower all the peoples</li>


</ul>
<h4>Cross platform</h4>
<p>Because we've adopted the <a href="https://webcomponents.org/">web component</a>











 standard in the development of both HAX (authoring system) and HAXCMS (content management), everything we create and compile via our <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory">open tooling</a>
 can support about 98.4% of all browser traffic globally without server side rendering. HAXcms also employs a progressive enhancement methodology meaning that it can hit 100% of all browsing traffic with content.</p>
<p>This means that you can use the latest and greatest of the web and not have to constantly worry about a library changing! The dawn of the age of web components is now, join the revolution!</p>
<h4>Platform support</h4>
<ul><li>Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS, Android, Firefox - no polyfill, last 3 versions!<br/></li>








<li>IE 11 / Edge / legacy everything - aggressive polyfills</li>

</ul>

<p>The elements that make up HAX can be delivered via a CDN or installed locally. This means that the functionality is tied <b>to the browser</b>











 and <b>NOT</b>











 to the platform itself (huh?). Well, think of all the complex functionality of any site you've ever built or used. Then add content to that site. Now move that site (in your mind) to another server. What has to be migrated to maintain the content functioning that isn't actually content?</p>
<h4>For example, take this quiz:</h4>
<multiple-choice title="Decoupled question" check-label="Check answer" reset-label="Reset" hide-title question="Is this decoupled... I mean.. REALLY decoupled, if it would work on other webpages?" correct-text="Great job!" incorrect-text="Better luck next time!" randomize typeof="oer:Assessment" resource="#dd2feacf-ed4a-dcb0-b85d" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " answers="[{&quot;correct&quot;:true,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Yeah this really will work anywhere!&quot;,&quot;userGuess&quot;:false},{&quot;correct&quot;:null,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;There's no way it actually is&quot;},{&quot;correct&quot;:null,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Decoupled?&quot;},{&quot;correct&quot;:null,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Umm.. I think?&quot;}]"></multiple-choice>
