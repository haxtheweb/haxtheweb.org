<h3>HAX encompasses many different projects</h3>
<p>This roadmap illustrates all the projects related to HAX and ELMS:LN, which HAX comes from. The little settings gears found throughout illustrate enhancements and next steps for the different projects in our wheel house.</p>
<img src="files/Roadmap.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/><p>As you can see, there's a lot of planned enhancements to HAXeditor and HAXcms with a lot of additional future capabilities in ELMS:LN as a result of these projects. It's important to understand these relationships through and how innovations flow between them.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Relationships of major pieces</h3>
<p>HAX has many different parts detailed here, so let's look at the relationship between these pieces before getting into the roadmap. HAX projects are part of the ELMS:LN organization and so ELMS:LN is also included in these roadmap details.</p>
<p>HAXiam, HAXcms, HAXeditor are three projects that make up the "HAX" name space, all of which benefit from being built on web components. HAXiam is a server technology while HAXcms is a mix of server and front end assets. HAXeditor is fully front-end code which then requires a backend to save and load pages from.</p>
<p>Below is an image consolidating information found on this site with arrows illustrating flow of innovation. Web components are always our building blocks, usually bubbling up as a need in either ELMS:LN, HAXcms or HAXeditor. From there, HAXeditor influences and improves ELMS:LN and HAXcms. ELMS:LN has a copy of HAXcms inside of it so sees improvements from both platforms. HAXiam just makes sure that copies of HAXcms are generated.</p>
