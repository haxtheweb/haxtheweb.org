<p slot="col-1">HAXcms powers this website and is a hybrid static site generator, a new class of CMS. It's hybrid in that everything is written to static like a static site generator and it's 100% decoupled via web components.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Micro-site manager, so manage multiple sites from a single HAXcms install</li>
<li>Each site is powered by static files which live in version control</li>
<li>Every change is executed by the front end via HAX / Outline tools</li>
<li>Every change is automatically tracked in version control (zip the folder and send it to a friend and it'll work)</li>
<li>The "database" is powered by a site.json file that lives with the site</li>
<li>All operations write to static files so every change is as if you editing HTML by hand (but you didn't... HAX did)</li>
<li>Ability to serve up as a static site on CDNs (this site is on GH pages + a CDN) via Publishing which makes a purely static copy with a service worker and the whole jazz for offline / installable capability (0 config)</li>
<li>Build your own themes via custom front end dev if you like or use one of our baked in ones</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is a flat file generator with a UI and the UI contextually loads based on if you should see it. It's weird, we know, and that's also why we have trouble describing what it is. It's a flat file CMS without tooling required. It's a sustainable way of building and maintaining a "CMS" as it has multiple pages, can handle custom fields, custom themes, but yet it doesn't require infrastructure to keep running beyond PHP / node / Beaker browser to act as a back end to edit the static files.</span></p>
<p><span>It's an organic CMS. A living yet permanent website. It's hacking the limitations of content authoring capabilities. It's why we say, we're HAX The Web.</span></p>
<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ul><li>Support all platforms and devices (CMS, App, etc)</li>
<li>Empower authors to write code without ever looking at code</li>
<li>All content produced must work with or without HAXeditor available</li>
<li>Support older markup, regardless of structure, as best we can</li>
<li>HAX will learn the rules of producing elements, it won't dictate them</li>
<li>Decentralize all the things, empower all the peoples</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cross platform</h4>
<p>Because we've adopted the <a href="https://webcomponents.org/">web component</a>

 standard in the development of both HAX (authoring system) and HAXCMS (content management), everything we create and compile via our <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory">open tooling</a>
 can support about 98.4% of all browser traffic globally without server side rendering. HAXcms also employs a progressive enhancement methodology meaning that it can hit 100% of all browsing traffic with content.</p>
<p>This means that you can use the latest and greatest of the web and not have to constantly worry about a library changing! The dawn of the age of web components is now, join the revolution!</p>
<h4>Platform support</h4>
<ul><li><i>Evergreen</i>
 <i>browsers</i>
 (93+% of traffic) - no polyfills!<br/></li>

<li>IE 11 / Edge <18 / legacy browsers - polyfills with simplified design</li>
<li><a href="/f-a-q-">See F.A.Q.</a>
 for a more detailed break out of stats</li>
</ul>

<p>The elements that make up HAX can be delivered via a CDN or installed locally. This means that the functionality is tied <b>to the browser</b>

 and <b>NOT</b>

 to the platform itself (huh?). Well, think of all the complex functionality of any site you've ever built or used. Then add content to that site. Now move that site (in your mind) to another server. What has to be migrated to maintain the content functioning that isn't actually content?</p>
