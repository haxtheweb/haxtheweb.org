<p>We've created a way to internationalize ANY web component you create. Because this is a complex topic, and we seek to empower anyone, anywhere to work with web components; i18n is a critical piece of accessibility and improving knowledge access on the web. Doing so without requiring a framework driven approach, or even knowing how our element will be used in production, is a complicated series of decisions.</p>
<a href="https://dev.to/btopro/i18n-manager-web-component-41a2">This blog series details these decisions</a>
<h3 id="header-ecb29a0d-0858-782b-80ef-34646ea1b56e">I18NMixin</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
      Install the mixin via yarn or npm: yarn add @lrnwebcomponents/i18n-manager
    </li>
    <li>
      create a folder in your element called /locales
    </li>
    <li>create a file called my-element.es.json for the spanish translation of your element. Japanese would be my-element.ja.json for example.</li>
  </ul>
<code-sample type="javascript" copy-clipboard-button>
  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">import { I18NMixin } from "@lrnwebcomponents/i18n-manager/lib/I18NMixin.js";
class MyElement extends I18NMixin(HTMLElement) {
  constructor() {
    this.t = {
      stuff: "Stuff"
    };
    this.registerLocalization({
      context: this,
      basePath: import.meta.url,
      locales: ["es", "ja"],
    });
    connectedCallback() {
      this.render();
    }
    render() {
      this.innerHTML = `<span>${this.t.stuff}</span>`;
    }
  }
}</template>
</code-sample>
<p>This invokes a dependency on our manager which you might not want to have in your element. If you want to do a similar approach but without dependencies, you just have to feed a custom event to our manager. You'll still have to use the  convention for translatable text, but here's how you can invoke the event needed</p>
<code-sample type="javascript" copy-clipboard-button>
  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">window.dispatchEvent(
      new CustomEvent("i18n-manager-register-element", {
        detail: {
          namespace: "my-element.haxProperties",
          localesPath: decodeURIComponent(import.meta.url) + "/../locales",
          locales: ["es"],
        },
      })
    );</template>
</code-sample>
<p>Using the vanilla approach, you'll still need to have a /locales directory and the same naming convention. Our mixin just simplifies the integration a bit as well as the timing of what it's initiated but this event registration method will still work within any element that's going to arrive in HAX/HAXcms or any property you make that isn't using HAX at all.</p>
