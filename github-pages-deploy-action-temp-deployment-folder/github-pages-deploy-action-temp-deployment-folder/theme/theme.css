/**
 * This is a custom theme css file. You can write whatever you want here
 * but realize you'll need to play by the rules of shadow dom. Meaning,
 * that if something is in a shadow root you won't be able to style it.
 *
 * There is hope though. We leverage CSS variables heavily and most of the
 * elements we have baked in do too.
 *
 * Also since our themes are built on Polymer, you can leverage what
 * are called "apply blocks". The apply block loos like @apply --whatever-stuff;
 * Think of it like a sass mixin, where you can apply any css you want
 * inside of that block and it'll apply downstream. Two examples are given below
