      <title>Why HAXcms</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//home/why-haxcms</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <grid-plate layout="8/4" responsive-size="md" style="width: 100%;">
<p slot="col-1">HAXcms, which powers this website, is hard to describe exactly what "kind" of system it is. That's because given that it's 100% web components, decoupled, and static by design, it's hard to put it in a category so let's just spell out some of the key features and you can decide</p>


<img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o7qDP28LG5LrVYfde/giphy.gif" alt="Gotham animation saying 'what is it?'" slot="col-2" style="width: 75%;"/>

<p><br/></p>
</grid-plate>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Micro-site manager, so manage multiple sites from a single HAXcms install</li>
<li>Each site is powered by static files which live in version control</li>

<li>Every change is executed by the front end via HAX / Outline tools</li>
<li>Every change is automatically tracked in version control (zip the folder and send it to a friend and it'll work)</li>
<li>The "database" is powered by a site.json file that lives with the site</li>
<li>All operations write to static files so every change is as if you editing HTML by hand (but you didn't... HAX did)</li>
<li>Ability to serve up as a static site on CDNs (this site is on GH pages + a CDN) via Publishing which makes a purely static copy with a service worker and the whole jazz for offline / installable capability (0 config)</li>
<li>Build your own themes via custom front end dev if you like or use one of our baked in ones</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">So it's a flat file generator with a UI and the UI contextually loads based on if you should see it. It's weird, we know, and that's also why we have trouble describing what it is. It's a flat file CMS without tooling required. It's a sustainable way of building and maintaining a "CMS" as it has multiple pages, can handle custom fields, custom themes, but yet it doesn't require infrastructure to keep running beyond PHP / node / Beaker browser to act as a back end to edit the static files.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">It's an organic CMS. A living yet permanent website. It's hacking the limitations of content authoring capabilities. It's why we say, we're HAX The Web.</span></p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>This is a general life cycle that happens when HAXcms "boots up". When web components are unpacking the contents of what to do it generally will work this way.</p>
<ul><li>page load, should it be no-js or a web component delivered, preflight</li>
<li>haxcms-site-builder loads site.json, reads JSON Outline Schema and starts to bootstrap that into a theme, items, title, etc</li>
<li>Appends a haxcms-editor-builder tag which checks for "context"</li>
<li>Context is established based on global values for php, nodejs, beaker, etc<br/></li>
<li>Uses a login end point to check if there's a JWT in the user's local data</li>
<li>When it finds a backend, it <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/tree/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/core/backends">injects a tag to bridge that backend</a>
</li>
<li>HAXeditor gets injected into the correct place in the theme which then all of that unpacks and does its thing</li>
</ul>

      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//troubleshooting</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>These are some common issues / resolutions in HAXcms related to installation, publishing, etc.</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">I installed HAXcms and forgot my password</h2>
<p>Your username and password can be found in _config/config.php on the server (assuming local development)</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">I clicked login and nothing happened and now I'm locked out.</h2>
<ul><li>Clear your browser cache. A cookie is set that might be invalid.</li>

<li>Open a new browser and try to login again</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="hax-active"><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I clicked publish and nothing happened</span></h2>
<ul><li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Publishing can take up to a minute or so at times since it's creating a commit, rewriting files and then the front end is waiting on the push to github before it triggers a successful response.</span></li>
<li>If it did fail to publish, you might not have git setup. Click the gear icon on the dashboard (site listing) and ensure you've setup github / git integration correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Realize that everything is just a file and that our json outline schema is very easy to read. So if there's an issue with something related to publishing, check _sites/mysite/site.json for publishing, then _config/config.json. All settings and variables cascade in this way. Settings are stored globally, then replicated locally to allow them to be pealed off and more easily imported / exported into other setups.</span></p>

      <title>Skin a site</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//skin-a-custom-theme</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Theme skinning is the easiest way to build a decent looking theme in HAXcms. This method is geared toward people that know CSS and HTML but can't get into the weeds of web components or javascript.</p>
<p>Workflow</p>
<ol><li>Make a new site in the HAXcms UI</li>

<li>Select "Custom theme" as your theme</li>
<li>In the file system go to _sites/<i style="">mynewsite</i>
/theme</li>
<li>Edit theme.html to modify the structure</li>
<li>Edit theme.css to modify the design</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is the easiest way to skin HAXcms to your liking. It's able to ship and work in CDNs and is the minimal barrier to entry for those used to seeing HTML and CSS files that they can touch and see the change. It requires no tooling to utilize either!</span></p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Do you know full on web component development? Well, you can build a new theme from scratch. The best way to learn is by picking a part some of our examples. For this we'll analyze the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/core/themes/haxcms-slide-theme.js#L1">haxcms-slide-theme</a>

.</p>
<h2>Import classes / web components</h2>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button" style="width: 100%;">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">import { html, PolymerElement } from "@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js";
import { HAXCMSTheme } from "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/core/HAXCMSThemeWiring.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/site/site-title.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/site/site-print-button.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/active-item/site-active-title.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-dot-indicator";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-menu-button.js";
import "@polymer/paper-icon-button/paper-icon-button.js";
import "@polymer/iron-icons/iron-icons.js";
import "@polymer/paper-tooltip/paper-tooltip.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/simple-colors/simple-colors.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/hax-body/lib/hax-shared-styles.js";</template>
</code-sample>
<p>As you can see this theme imports a few basic components helpful in the development of most themes. First we import PolymerElement and the HAXCMSTheme mix-in from our theme wiring library. Theme wiring provides a basis for wiring any custom element into the state management of HAXcms, typically without having to deal with any concepts of state!</p>
<h2>Mix-ins</h2>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">class HAXCMSSlideTheme extends HAXCMSTheme(PolymerElement) {</template>
</code-sample>
<p>Next we get the mix-in statement. Note how HAXCMSTheme wraps the PolymerElement class, thereby giving us a mix of the two together.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">HAXCMSTheme mix-in class</h3>
<p>You can learn more about what the mix-in class provides by <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/core/HAXCMSThemeWiring.js">digging into the HAXCMSThemeWiring.js</a>

 class. This class bridges the HAXcms store (written in mobx) with the design layer. This way you can leverage anything in the store by writing the polymer convention for referencing a data bound variable in the template.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/core/haxcms-site-store.js#L410-L428">Here's the variables you'll commonly see</a>

 in our themes, direct from the store with an example of what a dom bind of that would look like in a template</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"><h1>[[siteTitle]]</h1>
<h2>[[ancestorTitle</h2>
<h3>[[parentTitle]]</h3>
<h4>[[activeTitle]]</h4>
<div>
    [[activeItemFields.images.0.url]]
</div></template>
</code-sample>
<p>That last line with activeItemFields is part of the raw power under the hood of this approach. You can use HAXcms to create field definitions (in <a href="hax-shema">HAXschema</a>

) that then extend the capabilities of your pages.</p>
<h2>Required CSS</h2>
<p>There is one small required block of CSS when doing web component / theme development for HAXcms. It is the following:</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">/**
 * Hide the slotted content during edit mode. This must be here to work.
 */
:host([edit-mode]) #slot {
    display: none;
}</template>
</code-sample>
<p>This helps ensure that when your user clicks the edit button that they see the HAXeditor as opposed to the body of content they are currently working with. Then when they hit save, the HAXeditor sends the content to the backend which then updates the front end and they see the changes. This CSS ensures that it isn't visible during editing.</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Required HTML</h2>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"><div id="contentcontainer">
    <div id="slot"><slot></slot></div>
</div></template>
</code-sample>
<p>Related to the CSS, the following block of HTML must appear in your template somewhere (or in the case of <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/simple-blog/lib/simple-blog-post.js#L125-L127">simple-blog</a>
, an element leveraged by your theme). You can make this look like whatever you want beyond this but this ensures the HAXeditor can correctly target and be integrated using the HAXCMSTheme mix-in. There are ways to position and reposition the HAXeditor dynamically that will not be covered here but <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/simple-blog/simple-blog.js#L174">can be seen in simple-blog</a>
.</p>
<p>From there, design away. Write whatever CSS and HTML and JS you want! The example themes referenced in our docs all provide blue prints for different ways of leveraging our template system.</p>
<p>Next we'll discuss our Core template elements which you'll want to leverage in order to make theme development even cleaner!</p>

You didn't cover any of the query tags in that last section!</span>
</person-testimonial>
<p>Ok ok, here's the deal. Queries are so important that they needed their own section. Calm down Dwight we'll handle that now.<span style="caret-color: rgb(25, 30, 35);"> </span><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The <b><i>site-</i>

</b>

 query elements are incredibly powerful aspects of HAXcms theming that deserve their own section anyway.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/query/site-query.js">site-query</a>

</h2>
<h3>Code Example</h3>
<code-sample>  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">&lt; site-query

conditions='{"metadata.tag": "funny"}'
&gt;
&lt; /site-query&gt;

<iron-list id="list" items="[[__items]]" grid="" mutable-data="">

<person-testimonial elevation="1" image="https://media1.giphy.com/media/3o6wrgksPVF3SMrLHO/giphy.gif" name="sacha baron cohen" position="King of castles" accent-color="light-blue" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">  <span>Give me all of the pages who have a tag "Funny"</span>
</person-testimonial>
<h3 class="hax-active">When it's useful</h3>
<p>Always. This is by far the most powerful element in our library. It can query the site structure and effectively return anything, anywhere that matches the criteria. It is for exact criteria matching though so you won't be getting children of page X unless you specifically requested them.</p>
<p>This is great for getting things like getting all the pages that don't have parents (top level items) which is exactly how the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-top-menu.js#L116">site-top-menu</a>

 tag does it in conjunction with a dom-repeat tag (in that example).</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Caveats</h3>
<ul><li>This doesn't render anything by itself</li>


<li>You have to then know how to do a two way template bind (Polymer convention looking like <b>{{result}} </b>

or know how to use javascript in order to bind the results to visual output</li>

<li>Its incredibly powerful</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/query/site-query-menu-slice.js">site-query-menu-slice</a>

<br/></p>
<p>A menu slice query is one which takes part of a hierarchy and chops it out to return the items.</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button" style="width: 100%;">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"> &lt;
    site-query-menu-slice
    result="{{__items}}"
    dynamic-methodology="[[dynamicMethodology]]"

<h3 class="hax-active">Dynamic leveling</h3>
<p>The dynamic leveling flag would allow you to create a query that analyzes the current active item (as example). And then say "Always give me 2-3 levels below this". In that instance you've got a dynamic sub-set of children being returned.</p>
<h3>When it's useful</h3>
<p>This can be useful for a block that always shows the children of the current page in a documentation site.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/query/site-render-query.js">site-render-query</a>

</h2>
<p>A site render query attempts to standardize the practice of wiring site-query up to something visual. It requires you supply something visual to get going and has the unfortunate limitation though that what you render must not be dynamic in nature.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button" style="width: 100%;">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"><site-render-query class="cardlist" grid="">
        <template>
          <div style="padding:8px;">
            <paper-card heading="[[item.title]]" image="[[item.metadata.image]]" elevation="1" animated-shadow="false">
              <div class="card-content">
                <div>description: [[item.description]]</div>
                <div>location: [[item.location]]</div>
                <div>changed: [[item.metadata.updated]]</div>
              </div>
              <div class="card-actions">
                <a tabindex="-1" href$="[[item.location]]"><paper-button data-id$="[[item.id]]">Set as active</paper-button></a>
              </div>
            </paper-card>
          </div>
        </template>
      </site-render-query></template>
</code-sample>
<p><br/></p>
<magazine-cover header="Spoken query" text="Pull in everything in the site and then render each result based on what's in this template tag." image="https://media3.giphy.com/media/5xtDarAUbabd4JvWpaM/giphy.gif" action="Why is this falling heads?" icon="icons:thumb-up" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></magazine-cover>
<h3 class="hax-active">When it's useful</h3>
<p>When you have a static set of items you want to query once and have it be dynamic based on site infrastructure yet not be changing dynamically during site view.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Possible usage</h3>
<p>As we haven't rolled this into any themes at the time, this could be useful for placing a "latest posts" block or "upcoming events" block. Anything that's dynamic based on the data being passed in but yet unchanging once it's loaded. Think of this as a simple "views" construct if you are from the Drupal worldview.</p>

      <title>CSS vars</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//css</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>CSS can be modified via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables</a>
. CSS variables create a happy middle ground between the constraints of Shadow DOM (namely that styles are fully encapsulated) and designers wanting flexibility and control over design. We leverage CSS variables heavily in our template layer to allow you to "skin" just about any theme we have already.</p>
<h2>A note about @apply</h2>
<p>Unlike normal css variables, Polymer (the library we build our theme layer on) supports a convention for CSS variables that operate a bit more like Saas mixins. You can write blocks of code like <b>@apply --my-variable-blob;</b>
 which will then allow someone to mix in and apply whatever valid CSS attributes they want at that level. You can see several implemented below (both CSS variables and @apply blocks).</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Example</h2>
<p>This is an example from the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/core/themes/haxcms-basic-theme.js#L23">haxcms-basic-theme </a>
which forms a clean baseline for most sites.</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">// this is from the haxcms-basic-theme
site-top-menu {
    --site-top-menu-bg: #37474f;
    --site-top-menu-link-color: #ffffff;
    --site-top-menu-indicator-color: #ffffff;
    --site-top-menu-link-active-color: var(
    --haxcms-basic-theme-accent-color
    );
    --site-top-menu-indicator-arrow: 8px;
}
site-children-block {
    --site-children-block-button: {
    color: #ffffff;
    }
    --site-children-block-button-active: {
    background-color: #37474f;
    color: var(--haxcms-basic-theme-accent-color);
    }
}
.left-col {
    min-height: 250px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    background-color: #37474f;
    color: white;
    padding: 16px;
}
site-active-title {
    display: inline-flex;
    --site-active-title-heading: {
    font-family: "Montserrat", "Helvetica", "Tahoma", "Geneva", "Arial",
        sans-serif;

      <title>Dev workflows</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//dev-workflows</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Our development workflow is as follows (for themes)</p>
<ol><li>All custom theme work happens in your _config directory</li>

<li>Make my-theme.js, pull everything together, either in this directory or in a <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory">wcfactory</a>
 catalog  of elements you've made</li>
<li>Reference this in you _config/my-custom-elements.js element</li>
<li>Update the _config/config.json block that says <b>themes</b>
 to include something like...</li>
</ol>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button" style="width: 100%;">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">"themes": {
    "odl-haxtheme": {
      "element": "odl-haxtheme",
      "path": "@myorganization/odl-haxtheme/odl-haxtheme.js",
      "name": "Eberly ODL"
    }
  },</template>
</code-sample>
<p>This tells HAXcms UI that you can now select the theme (but don't yet, it won't be valid)</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Local development workflow during theme development</h2>
<p>We use polymer cli to serve up and work on web components locally and while you don't have to, it's recommended as part of the WCFactory workflow.</p>
<ol><li>Make a new site in the HAXcms UI</li>

<li>Go to _sites/mynewsite and run <i><b>polymer serve --npm --open --entrypoint dist/dev.html</b>
</i>
</li>
<li>Adjust the URL that opens to only be the IP address with no path after it</li>
<li>You'll see your site open up for local development work, which will be leveraging any assets referenced in your node_modules directory at the HAXcms project root.</li>
<li>To add / install new assets run yarn (or npm) <i style="font-weight: bold;">add @what/ever-you-want --save </i>
, just like you would any other project you work on in FE dev</li>
<li>edit your site's site.json manually to update the theme to point to the theme location your actively working on</li>
<li>Develop away until it is to your liking</li>
</ol>
<h2>Shipping the theme</h2>
<p>To ship the theme, you'll need to do a polymer build routine</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">important note</h3>
<p>This currently forks you from the original source of HAXcms core (because it will recompile the assets). If you're ok with this cool, just know <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/HAXcms/issues/145">we're trying to find ways around this involving rollup</a>
.</p>
<ol><li>Go to the HAXcms project root</li>

<li>run <b><i>polymer build</i>
</b>
</li>
<li>Copy the build directory and go to your site</li>
<li>Delete the symlink and replace it with your build directory</li>
<li>Now you can publish via the UI so long as you do not leverage a CDN</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="hax-active">The future</h2>
<p>Admittedly, the full on custom theme / web component development workflow is rough. It's hard to maintain a built copy in a modular system without tooling. In the future we plan on having tooling workflows built directly into WCFactory that allow you to streamline the development and creation of HAXcms themes.</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Current limitations</h2>
<p>You can't leverage existing CDNs (like webcomponents.psu.edu and whatever else is out there) that are pegged to the HAXcms project's source. You'll be creating a custom theme which then creates a custom build in effect so you'll want to ensure that you have some place that you can host the assets in order to power your site.</p>

<li>Try out the <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/demos">HAXcms live demo</a>

 (this website has no backend)</li>

<li>Reach out in in the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms">HAXcms issue queue</a>

 with questions</li>

<li>Bring this website to developers in your organization or other code junkies and tell them to explore</li>

</ul>
<p>HAX makes up multiple projects across hundreds of web components and various other repos. It can be a bit overwhelming but I want you to imagine something... Imagine being a developer on HAX.</p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>As you can see, the minimalist theme is for trying to give you a straight forward, linear design pattern.</p>
<p>Pages are ordered based on the very 1 page's child pages.</p>
<p>So you'd have a structure like this:</p>
<ul><li>Home</li>
<ul><li>Page 1</li>
<li>Page 2</li>
<li>Page 3</li>
</ul>

<li>This page wouldn't show up in the nav</li>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>The Basic theme provides a simple yet highly themable structure. It's leveraging the bulk of our custom elements specifically geared toward HAXcms state encapsulation</p>
<a11y-gif-player src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/qdDO6hTcyeDks/giphy.gif" src-without-animation="https://media2.giphy.com/media/qdDO6hTcyeDks/480w_s.jpg" alt="Despicable me whaaat?! silly meme" resource="#dbb0d209-57da-d49d-4e4c" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " style="width: 50%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></a11y-gif-player>
<p>The theme elements in HAXcms can completely encapsulate state. So the menu on the left of this design (as one example) is called<b> `< site - children - block ><site -="" children="" block="">`</site>
</b>

. Site children block will automatically show what's below the current page / inside the ancestor tree as the current hierarchy.</p>
<p>That means if you used it in your theme, you could easily just style it and never have to think about state management / what's active. This approach is in all our themes at some level, the most pervasive of which is the next and previous buttons which are <b>`< site - menu - button type="next >`</b>

 in their format.</p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Outline player is an even more basic form of Learn two. It's for those seeking something even more minimalist in design and capabilities.</p>
<p>Fun things about this include... ok well very little. Let's face it, this was the first theme we made and then we decided to keep supporting it because it helps illustrate the modular nature of our UI layer.</p>
<p>As examples</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">The `< site - menu >` on the left side is the exact same tag that's found in the <a href="learn-two">Learn Two theme</a>
. The buttons at the top are the same as in other themes (most of the initial ones). This abstraction of state from design allows you to focus on CSS and leave the front end engineering to... well.. no one, it just sorta happens.</p>

      <title>Core elements</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//elements</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>While you're not required to use them, HAXcms supplies a series of elements that can make theme development effortless. You can see the source of these in greater detail under the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/tree/master/elements/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components">theme directory of haxcms-elements</a>


. This is a brief overview of what they are and what they provide to your interface.</p>
<p>HAXcms seeks to apply the SDS pattern, a technique we made up just for this sentence, for <i>dramatic effect</i>
. As everyone knows who is about to read the next heading, SDS stands for:</p>
<h2>So. Damn. Semantic.</h2>
<img src="files/2019-03-12_16-45-51.png" alt="Learn two theme code view with arrows pointing out all the different HAXcms theme level elements" style="width: 100%;"/><p>Whew, I need an ice cold drink to wash away the semantic sweats.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right, HAXcms allows you to theme a complex state managed system without needing to understand state management... like... at all.</p>
<h3>"But I understand state management and it's important to me"</h3>
<p>That's awesome, four people on twitter, but most designers just want to design! They don't need or want to understand the intricacies of making a collapsed field area expand relative to what item has been dictated as active in the store*.</p>
<p><sub>*an intentionally confusing worded sentence</sub>


</p>
<p><sub>We use MobX to do our state management if that's something you care about and some of our themes directly implement and interface with the state management layer. See <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/simple-blog/lib/simple-blog-footer.js#L5-L6">Simple Blog's footer element</a>


 for a great example of why state management is a PITA.</sub>

</p>
<h2>Back to the elements jerk</h2>
<p>Ok fine, here they are. Here's the list of ES module imports to get them</p>
<code-sample style="width: 100%;" copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">{
    "dependencies": {
        "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements": "latest"
    }
}</template>
</code-sample>
<code-sample style="width: 100%;" copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/active-item/site-active-title.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/blocks/site-children-block.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/blocks/site-outline-block.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/layout/site-footer.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/layout/site-modal.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-breadcrumb.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-dot-indicator.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-menu-button.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-menu.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/navigation/site-top-menu.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/query/site-query-menu-slice.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/query/site-query.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/query/site-render-query.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/site/site-print-button.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/site/site-rss-button.js";
import "@lrnwebcomponents/haxcms-elements/lib/ui-components/site/site-title.js";</template>
</code-sample>
<p>Now here's what each of them provide you (pretty self explanatory because #SDS)</p>
<ul><li><b>site-active-title - </b>
the title of the active item wrapped in a h1 tag
<br/></li>
<li><b>site-children-block</b>
 - all child menu items based on a criteria match</li>
<li><b>site-outline-block</b>
 - part of the outline based on criteria match</li>
<li><b>site-footer</b>
 - a basic footer with license element based on site details</li>
<li><b>site-modal</b>
 - a basic modal with button that can house other elements</li>
<li><b>site-breadcrumb</b>

 - a breadcrumb trail for the active menu item</li>
<li><b>site-dot-indicator</b>
 - site links but as a simple line of dots</li>
<li><b>site-menu-button</b>
 - buttons for navigating through the active items in the menu. This is next, previous, parent and first child kinds of options.<br/></li>


<li><b>site-menu</b>

 - A visualization of the hierarchy of your site, complete with checkmarks given per page the user goes to (optional) as well as a lot of styling options and a highlighted bar that scrolls the menu into view for small screens. It's fantastic and one line.</li>
<li><b>site-top-menu</b>
 - Top level menu links with indicator that scrolls to focus</li>
<li><b>site-print-button</b>
 - print button with support for 4 levels of printing the site<br/></li>
<li><b>site-rss-button</b>
 - a button that displays a link (opened in a new window) to get the RSS feed in RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0 format (also applies correct semantic values for bots to discover)<br/></li>
<li><b>site-title</b>
 - a link to the homepage of the site wrapped in an h1 tag<br/></li>


</ul>

<h2><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A word about style</span></h2>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We use CSS variables to style all the bits inside of our custom elements. So if you don't like the styling, look at the CSS variables we make available and style away. The <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/learn-two-theme/src/learn-two-theme.css">"Learn 2 theme"</a>


 is a great example implementing multiple levels of styling against multiple HAXcms site elements. You can always you know, go back and <a href="css">reread the CSS variables section</a>
.</span></p>

      <title>Installation</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//installation</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h2>Generic PHP install directions</h2>
<p>Have PHP? well then you can setup HAXcms pretty quick. Just download HAXcms and navigate to its directory in a browser. It'll attempt to automatically install (which is to create two basic folders). If all goes well you'll see some ASCii art telling you what your password is. HAXcms seeks to be a 0 config installation so if anything didn't work or make sense, just drop us a line in the issue queues.</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Or from Command Line...</h2>
<p>Just run this one command and you'll be HAXing the web in no time! This will step you through prompts (which can be scripted via arguments) to feed the backend what it needs to create the few configuration files it uses to load.</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button="copy-clipboard-button" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"># HAX the web and answer the prompts
bash scripts/haxtheweb.sh</template>
</code-sample>
<h3><sub>A note on bash</sub>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p><sub>If you're having issues installing via the bash script, ensure you are on bash version 4.x. Some OS flavors start at 3.x which won't work.</sub>

</p>
<p></p>
<h2>MAMP</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a>





 allows Mac and PC users to rapidly install a working webdev stack on their machine. Here's the steps you need to take if using this (or on similar site hosting).</p>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Download the </span><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/HAXcms/archive/master.zip" style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">latest copy of HAXcms from github</a>


 and<span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> p</span><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">lace this in </span><i style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MAMP/htdocs </i>
<span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">either at the root level (as in copying the files you download into htdocs as shown in the image below) or by placing the folder in the directory (in the case where you have MAMP already installed / want to keep things tidy).</span></p>
<media-image source="files/mampstructure.jpg" caption="MAMP file structure under htdocs directory" size="wide" card box resource="#990ebe5c-04c8-58b2-385a" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " style="width: 25%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></media-image>
<p><i>Open MAMP and hit the Start Servers Button</i>


</p>
<media-image source="files/mampstart.jpg" caption="MAMP start page when opening the application (image 2)" size="wide" card box resource="#4e5cac2b-786f-596c-b394" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " style="width: 25%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></media-image>
<p><i>Click MY WEBSITE in MAMP start page to get started</i>


</p>
<img src="files/mamppage.jpg" alt="MAMP starting page top menu bar screenshot." style="width: 50%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"/><p>Now you can build website organically off of MAMP!</p>
<h2>DDEV / Docksal / Lando / Vagrant</h2>
<p>We recommend using HAXcms in a docker container manager like <a href="https://www.drud.com/what-is-ddev/">ddev</a>





, though based on above you can see basically we're just downloading and running one command to get going. We support all of the above methods so pick the one you work with most often.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone this repo: <code>git clone https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms.git</code>






</li>







<li>install <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community" rel="nofollow">docker</a>






</li>







<li><a href="https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation" rel="nofollow">install ddev</a>






 or <a href="https://docksal.io/installation/" rel="nofollow">install docksal</a>






 or <a href="https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/installing.html" rel="nofollow">install lando</a>






 or <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">install vagrant</a>






 (We support 'em all!)</li>







<li>open a terminal window, go to the directory and type <code>ddev start</code>






 (for ddev) or <code>fin init</code>






 (for docksal) or <code>lando start && lando magic</code>






 (for lando) or <code>vagrant up</code>






 (for vagrant)</li>







<li>go to the link any of them give you in a browser</li>







<li>username/password is <code>admin</code>






/<code>admin</code>






 to get building out static sites locally that you can push up anywhere!</li>







<li>Click the icon in the top right and you're off and running!</li>







</ul>

      <title>Structure</title>
      <link>https://haxtheweb.org//structure</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>By design we've got a very simple structure. The goal of HAXcms isn't to lock you into anything and so we've simplified our file structure over other solutions.</p>
<p>The key directories / files include:</p>
<ul><li>files - any files you've uploaded through the HAX interface</li>

<li>pages - folders named by their content uri that have index.html in it, no structure other then what you created when hitting save</li>
<li>site.json - JSON Outline Schema object that defines the pages in your site and their relationship to each other<br/></li>
<li>index.html - front page of the PWA that stitch it all together</li>
<li>service-worker.js - makes it a PWA, no need to edi this</li>
</ul>
